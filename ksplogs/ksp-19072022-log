Created Image texture and noise texture for sun's surface.

Used bump shader on top of the image texture

Used color ramp to get realistic solar surface color

Mixed image and noise textures using math shader, added it to the solar surface normals to simulate the changing solar surface on top of a base solar texture(in real life even the base changes every 11 years)

Created solar atmosphereand animation i.e rising flames using quick_smoke

Added emission and fresnel shaders for realistic solar surface and atmosphere

Added Force field object to stimulate the rising flames of the sun

Rendered the model using python entirely
