Randomized the color of the sparkles

Tried various color schemes for donut icings, and sparkles

Modified the subsurface properties for more realism

Created a plate to keep the donuts in and a table to keep the plate

Created a second donut with modified icing layer as one donut is not enough

Adjusted the second donut to be resting on the first donut

Experimented with various lighting and camera angles to get a perfect render/snapshot of the donuts

FINALLY, TASK 1 IS COMPLETED!!!
